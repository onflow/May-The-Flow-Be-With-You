### **🔄 Complete Learning Flow Example**

```
1. User: "I want to get better at remembering numbers"
   
2. AI: "Based on your progress, I recommend the Major System! 
   You've mastered observation and linking, so you're ready for 
   number encoding. Let me teach you the phonetic code..."
   
3. AI provides structured lesson with examples
   
4. AI: "Now practice with Speed Challenge using Major System 
   technique. Start with 2-digit numbers."
   
5. User plays Speed Challenge, scores 450 with 75% accuracy
   
6. AI: "Great start! Your 75% accuracy shows you're grasping 
   the concept. I noticed you struggled with 7s and 9s. 
   Remember: 7=K/G, 9=P/B. Try these practice words..."
   
7. AI: "Ready for your next challenge? Let's try 3-digit 
   numbers or explore the Peg System for sequences."
