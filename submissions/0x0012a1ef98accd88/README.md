# Flow Hackathon Project

## Project Overview
This project is part of the **"May the Flow be with You"** hackathon, focused on creating innovative, blockchain-powered applications using Flow EVM and smart contracts.

The submission for **Week 1** is **Lucky Spinning Wheel**, a fun and fair game that uses verifiable randomness from Flow EVM's VRF beacon to power a spinning wheel. Each spin delivers a provably random result, providing a trustworthy user experience.

The submission for **Week 2** is **Minesweeper Online**, a nostalgic twist on the classic Windows-era game, where bomb placements are securely randomized using Flow EVM's VRF. It brings on-chain fairness and unpredictability to a familiar gameplay experience, blending retro UI with decentralized technology.

The submission for **Week 3** is **Game of Life**, an interactive simulation of Conway's famous cellular automaton, reimagined as a Web3 dApp. The evolution of the grid is governed by deterministic logic based on Conway's rules, with each generation being verifiable and timestamped on-chain using Flow EVM.

The submission for **Week 4** is **Convince Me Agent**, an AI-powered agent built on Coinbase's AgentKit that uses Flow EVM's VRF to make decisions about sending FLOW tokens. Users must convince the agent of their worthiness before receiving any funds, creating an engaging experience that combines AI conversation with blockchain randomness.

## Motivation
The goal of this project is to explore and leverage the Flow blockchain's capabilities to create engaging applications that align with the weekly themes of the hackathon:

For Week 1's **Randomness Revolution** theme, the project demonstrates:
- Integration with Flow VRF for secure randomness
- On-chain randomness consumption in a Solidity contract
- A responsive frontend showing the spinning animation tied to VRF outcomes

For Week 2's theme, the project builds on:
- Classic game mechanics powered by verifiable randomness
- Fair and unpredictable gameplay using Flow VRF
- A nostalgic UI experience with modern web tech (Next.js + 98.css)

For Week 3's theme, the project showcases:
- On-chain state management for cellular automaton
- Deterministic game logic with verifiable evolution
- Modern UI with TailwindCSS and responsive design

For Week 4's theme, the project demonstrates:
- AI-powered conversation using AgentKit
- Integration of Flow VRF for decision-making
- Interactive token transfers on Flow testnet
