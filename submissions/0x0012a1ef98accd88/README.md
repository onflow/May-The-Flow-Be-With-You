# Flow Hackathon Project

## Project Overview
This project is part of the **"May the Flow be with You"** hackathon, focused on creating innovative, blockchain-powered applications using Flow EVM and smart contracts.

The submission for **Week 1** is **Lucky Spinning Wheel**, a fun and fair game that uses verifiable randomness from Flow EVM’s VRF beacon to power a spinning wheel. Each spin delivers a provably random result, providing a trustworthy user experience.

The submission for **Week 2** is **Minesweeper Online**, a nostalgic twist on the classic Windows-era game, where bomb placements are securely randomized using Flow EVM’s VRF. It brings on-chain fairness and unpredictability to a familiar gameplay experience, blending retro UI with decentralized technology.

## Motivation
The goal of this project is to explore and leverage the Flow blockchain's capabilities to create engaging applications that align with the weekly themes of the hackathon:

For Week 1’s **Randomness Revolution** theme, the project demonstrates:
- Integration with Flow VRF for secure randomness
- On-chain randomness consumption in a Solidity contract
- A responsive frontend showing the spinning animation tied to VRF outcomes

For Week 2’s theme, the project builds on:
- Classic game mechanics powered by verifiable randomness
- Fair and unpredictable gameplay using Flow VRF
- A nostalgic UI experience with modern web tech (Next.js + 98.css)
