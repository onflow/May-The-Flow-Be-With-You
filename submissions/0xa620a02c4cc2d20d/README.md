# Flow Hackathon Project

## Project Overview
This project is part of the "May the Flow be with You" hackathon, focused on creating innovative, blockchain-powered applications using Flow EVM and smart contracts.

The submission for Week 2 is Ace Card Guessing Game, a web-based card guessing game that uses Flow blockchain for random number generation. Players can select one of four aces and test their luck against the blockchain-powered random number generator.

## Team
👨‍💻 Developer: Angus
📬 Flow Address: 0xa620a02c4cc2d20d

## Live Demo
Play the game here: [Guess Next Card](https://may-the-flow-be-with-you-frontend-leaderboard.vercel.app/)

## Features
- Interactive card selection interface
- Real-time visual feedback for selections and results
- Blockchain-powered random number generation using Flow VRF in Solidity
- Beautiful card animations and effects
- Responsive design

## Game Rules
1. Select one of the four aces (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, or Spades)
2. Click "Generate Next Ace" to get a random card
3. If your selected card matches the generated card, you win!

## Technical Details
- Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Uses ethers.js for blockchain interaction
- Integrates with Flow blockchain for random number generation
- Implements Flow VRF (Verifiable Random Function) in Solidity for secure randomness
- Responsive grid layout
- Custom animations and visual effects

## Smart Contract
The game uses a Flow smart contract for random number generation:
- Contract Address: `0x91502a85Ad74ba94499145477dccA19b3E1D6124`
- Network: Flow Testnet
- View on Flowscan: [Smart Contract](https://evm-testnet.flowscan.io/address/0x91502a85Ad74ba94499145477dccA19b3E1D6124?tab=contract_source_code)
- Uses Flow VRF in Solidity for provably fair random number generation

## Motivation
The goal of this project is to explore and leverage the Flow blockchain's capabilities to create engaging applications that align with the weekly themes of the hackathon.

The project will introduce new ideas aligned with each weekly theme:

- Week 1 – Randomness Revolution: ❌ Missed
- Week 2 – ✅ Ace Card Guessing Game using Flow's VRF beacon
- Week 3 – ❌ Missed
- Week 4 – ✅ Blockchain Quiz with AI-Generated Questions
