# Convince Me Agent - Initial Submission

## Date: May 18, 2025

## Overview  
This is the initial submission for Week 4 of the Flow Hackathon under the **Randomness Revolution** theme.

**Convince Me Agent** is an AI-powered agent built on the [Coinbase AgentKit](https://github.com/coinbase/agentkit) starter template that uses Flow EVM's Verifiable Random Function (VRF) to make decisions about sending FLOW tokens. The agent requires users to convince it of their worthiness before sending any funds, making the process both entertaining and fair through blockchain-verified randomness.

The project is built using **Next.js** for the frontend and integrates with **Flow EVM** to handle transactions and randomness verification. All transactions are performed on the Flow testnet, allowing users to safely test their convincing skills without using real funds.
