# May the Flow Be With You

This repository documents my progress in the **May the Flow Be With You** coding challenge (May 2025). Each week’s folder will include a unique project submission exploring Flow blockchain concepts using Cadence and front-end tools.

## 📅 Week 1 — Randomness Revolution 🎲

**Theme:** Randomness on-chain without oracles

For Week 1, I created an interactive smart contract that simulates a **spin-the-wheel game** with weighted reward segments. Users connect their wallet through the React frontend and trigger a Flow transaction that emits a spin result based on a deterministic pseudo-random number (derived from block timestamps).

- ✅ Smart contract deployed to Flow Testnet: `0xb3905e10b1e5c542`
- ✅ Frontend built in React with animated wheel and FCL wallet integration
- ❌ No token transfers yet — rewards are virtual labels (e.g., "100 FLOW", "Try Again")

🧠 Key learning from Week 1: building a deterministic reward system on-chain without access to true randomness, and handling FCL transaction logic on the frontend.
